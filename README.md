# Topic-Modelling

## Introduction

Welcome to the Topic Modelling Project! This project focuses on clustering short texts and performing topic modelling using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to efficiently group related topics together in a semi-supervised learning setup.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will use word embeddings, particularly Word2Vec, to capture the semantic meaning of short texts. By leveraging dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE, SVD, and PCA, we will transform high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional representations, preserving essential patterns and reducing noise.

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- NLTK
- Gensim
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (for running deep learning models, if applicable)
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)



## Results

Upon completion of the project, you should obtain well-clustered topics, along with visualizations that reveal the relationships between different topics in the short text data.

## Acknowledgments

This project makes use of various open-source libraries, including NLTK, Gensim, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning, if applicable. We extend our gratitude to the developers of these libraries for their contributions to the NLP community.

## Conclusion

This Topic Modelling Project provides valuable insights into the field of NLP and showcases the power of word embeddings and dimensionality reduction techniques in clustering short texts and extracting meaningful topics. We hope this project serves as a useful resource for anyone interested in exploring NLP and its applications in topic modelling.

For any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers.

Happy clustering!
